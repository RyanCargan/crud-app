MERN stack application.

## Tech Stack

Dependencies not listed in package.json files are listed here.

- Node.js runtime v16.16.0
- PNPM package manager v7.1.1 (the current lockfile is only compatible with pnpm but npm and yarn will probably work fine with just the package.json file)

.mjs files are used to enable EcmaScript module syntax (instead of the older CommonJS syntax) in the backend project without using bundlers or editing package.json.
